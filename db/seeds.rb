# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# dog = Dog.create!(
#   name: "Barney",
#   breed: "Purple Dinosaur",
#   age: 20,
# )
# dog = Dog.create!(
#   name: "Spot",
#   breed: "Dalmation",
#   age: 4,
# )
# dog = Dog.create!(
#   name: "Amber",
#   breed: "German Shepherd, Black Labrador",
#   age: 10,
# )
# dog = Dog.create!(
#   name: "Tulsa",
#   breed: "GoldenDoodle",
